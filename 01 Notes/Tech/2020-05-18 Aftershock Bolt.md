#### Notes

Finally broke on 2024-01-09. PSU still works when I tested it, so I think its a motherboard issue.

It has been acting up a bit in the past, so its time for a new PC. I think I sent it for repair either once or twice. I managed to fix it recently by unscrewing and rescrewing the SSD.

Did a bit of research then placed an order for my [[01 Notes/Tech/2024-01-09 Mansa Flow|Flow]] from Mansa Computers.
