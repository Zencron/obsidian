ironfell style unit combat unlikely because of significant graphical requirement
4x style army combat with simulated battles
ironfell tile system and movement with fog
upkeep for army units. food and gold as wages
bands form armies
defeating a dungeon to be able to install a crystal to permanently gain a world. temporary realms otherwise. gain resources only and delete the world? or leave space to build units like ironfell windmills/farms. probably not if not going ironfell unit style. if world is deleted, can lessen requirements to permanently gain world?
going a noncombat route can lead to golems which require no upkeep as army
