farm with 3 tabs: grow/fish/hunt?
yea i like this. farm tab to gather resources. different tabs can be different thingys
so garden can be a minigame when u click to harvest and the bar goes from down from ?/100 and replenishes over time. at first you onlt harvest blueberries but get more as u upgrade. u can upgrade replenish rate and max grown too.

explore system instead of combat

so i'l have hunger and thirst and maybe something like knowledge where u have to just testa  nunber against a signpost?

idk whether to bring food or to eat to increase stats tho. both?

maybe have no permanent upgrades for stats. only upgrade the weight and thus the food you can carry. every food gives a stat bonus for that run only.

nah i think im going back to upgrades. lets just do the basic list detail layout but with grid instead of list. we can do upgrades or whatever for the rest then

garden doesnt do upgrades. instead, spend 1 seed to grow 1 blueberry bush, which always produces 1 blueberry per minute

get more seeds from adventure

sour blueberry bush costs 10 blueberry seeds

fatigue bar like hp/mp that keeps dropping when you're in combat to limit how long you can stay

roguelike deckbuilder game where to get a rng number you draw a random card from the deck and the dice is printed on the card like in the fighting fantasy dicerolls

boardgame snakes and ladders style with upgrades exploring for the next tab in asobpbid
