i rlly like that she is easy to talk to and i think she would be potential best friend material even if i wasn't romatically interested

didnt have a big crush/infatuation on her at the start
but i realize a love at first sight kinda drama is kinda unrealistic

i really like that she takes the initiative, like when we first met, she was being quite flirty and forward which is nice

similarly, i like that shes direct? cody agreed that she was very direct, but yea he said that it was both a good and a bad thing. personally i do like it, i think it makes more sense to just bring up your issues and talk about them rather than just scrunch them in

introspective. honestly this is a big one. not introspection per se, but more the self improvement aspect i think is really important. its something i've been doing recently as well, so its a quality that i would like to see in a partner

kind? honestly i've been thinking that she really doesn't hit my definition of kindness. when i say kind, i mean being kind of selfless and willing to do whats best for others at one's own expense, at least sometimes.
not to use her own words against her, but i feel like she can be kind of 'calculative', and that everything she does is serving some kind of purpose for her. when she ditched us to climb at funan instead of bff, it felt like she was prioritizing her own happiness over mine/ours, which is totally fine, but it just doesn't quite hit what i expect when i say i want my partner to be 'kind'

i feel like she has changed, or has been trying to improve. for example, with the honesty thing, when i told her i would prefer to hear about things even though it might hurt me, i think she made an effort to tell me more. also, when she cut things off with adrian, i feel like thats showing that she is willing to invest in this relationship. its a strong in good faith action, even if i dont need it.

im really thankful that i met her, and that this is my first real relationship, because it really feels healthy. and of course i have no point of comparison, but i honestly feel that way. like with handling conflict or having difficult conversations, i like that she is willing to bring up difficult topics. although idk early on she said she wiped our chat so hmmm

she's also been very patient with me so far. like with the physical touch thing and kissing and all. and that night when we were makung out at her house she made sure i was ok and even recently with the having sex thing shes like making sure not to rush me which is nice

i feel like she doesn't trust me, which ok is totally valid. we've only known each other a little while, and she has no real reason to trust me fully.
when she didn't want to show me her tinder profile photos, i felt like it was such a simple thing that she was refusing to share, especially since she was willing to show her photos to jerry

another issue i have is similar to trust, but specifically concerning her honesty
when amelie and jerry said i was boring, she didnt tell me until much later on. when i asked about amelie's impression of me, she didnt tell me that amelie thought i was boring, and as far as im concerned, an omission of truth like that is basically a lie. so why does she feel like she has/wants to lie to me?
in this case, i understand that maybe she felt like knowing would only hurt me, and if she were in my position, she would want to know. however, i think i made it clear that i absolutely would prefer honesty, even to the point of hurting myself.
when she said that she didnt tell me because it wasnt important, i feel like thats absolutely just a cop out rubbish answer
i understand that in the end it was more or less a white lie, but it still feels very hurtful that
