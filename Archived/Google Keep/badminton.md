footwork:
slow down
stay on toes
squat lower
feet face the front
lunge deeper when going forward
dont bend knees when serving
even stance when at the back
dont let knees move too forward when crouching?

other:
when killing at net, stretch out arm fully, use wrist, and try to cross the net a lil bit. don't be afraid to cross basically

old

looking at my videos, i think i have no forearm pronation. i need to cock my elbow before i smash i think
stance: on my toes. dont rest
i really need to turn to the side before smashing. turn to the side then u can make a big hip and body rotation
lift left hand up
squat properly. lower i guess
mingsheng's advice: dont cut mid court lifts when partner is smashing. let partner finish with a strong smash
gotta kick my right leg thru to the front and bend down a lot instead of letting my right leg swing out
take the shuttle high. i think turn a bit to the left when hitting so i can hit the shuttle directly above me instead of to the side
bend knees more instead of taking a eider stance to go lower

stay further back to receive smashes during singles
during singles, dont need to smash everything. maybe play softer smashes too

trainings:
box game practice to improve driving and attacking skills. maybe even in doubles?
gotta do some smash drills
do lobbing drills with these concepts too and try to hit back to back. idk why i cant now :( do lobbing following the smash form below

smash things:
tilt my body sideways to face the right before smashing
raise your arm and take the shuttle high
loosen my grip and only tighten at the last moment
gotta do this for lobbing and try to maintain the same starting form for drops also
